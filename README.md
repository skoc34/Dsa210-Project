Spotify Mood Analysis ðŸŽ§

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze my own Spotify listening data to reveal my music habits and their relationship to my mood. Using the Spotify Web API, I will collect data about the tracks I listen to, their sonic characteristics (e.g. energy, valence), and related metadata such as genres and artists. The ultimate goal is to understand how music affects my mood and provide personalized recommendations based on data.Additionally, I can also examine how the weather affects the types of music I listen to.
